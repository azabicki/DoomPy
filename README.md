# DoomPy

> : a python gui to keep track of scoring _while_ playing [**Doomlings**](https://doomlings.com/)


## Introduction

### _Doomlings_
Ever since friends backed the original version on Kickstarter and the game finally arrived, we've been more than just addicted to Doomlings from the very first second. Unfortunately, we don't live too close to one another, so we only see each other every few weeks/months. But WHEN we do see each other, it's set in stone that at least (!) one Doomlings session has to be played!

And anyone who knows the game knows how much you can annoy each other by stealing yet another card from the deck. And sometimes you don't even want to, especially not to jeopardise the peace that has just been restored. But if it has to be done, we thought it would only be fair if the player in the lead got it. 

So we always tried to get a quick overview of the others' points. But with all the scoring rules, it's quite difficult to work out who's in the lead. Especially as we extended it to 4 disasters at some point.

### _+ Python_

After many years of MATLAB and several unsuccessful attempts to switch to Python, I finally started using Python at the end of 2023 and turned my back on MATLAB for good. And what's the best way to learn a programming language? With an interesting project! 

### _= DoomPy_

So it was only natural for my first python project to be a Doomlings points live counter. Consequently,

- **Doom**lings + **Py**thon = **DoomPy** 

was born. With **DoomPy** you can easily allocate the traits to the respective players, select catastrophes & MOLs, and thus see what the score looks like at any time.

## Methods

If you take a look at my code, please keep in mind that I'm new to Python and forgive the likely little Python-like chaos.
In the past I've been coding mostly in academia, especially with MATLAB. Therefore my coding style is very procedural. I have never coded in an object-orientated way. So I'm sure that, especially in this case, there would be a much more efficient OOP alternative... but that might be a project for the future when I learn OOP.

### How to run

As this is also the first time that I am sharing a Python project with the world, this also poses new challenges for me. 
I think (hope) it should be possible for anyone with the provided [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) to set up a virtual environment in which DoomPy has to run.

Just [download the repository](https://github.com/azabicki/DoomPy/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), unzip it, and install the virtual environment with the toll of your choice. Finally, run 

    `python /path/to/DoomPy/main.py`

and have fun playing Doomlings!!
