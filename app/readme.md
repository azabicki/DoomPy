# DoomPy App

> An Online Streamlit Application


Since I also learned to write [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) apps in the past couple of months, I figured it would be a nice addition to **_DoomPy_** if I try write an online version of it.

That would make **_DoomPy_** much more accessible, since not everybody is able to run the python-based GUI version.

The disadvantage is that this version is not as performant and responsive, which means sometimes you have to wait a few fractions of a second, and not everything runs as fast and smooth as the Python GUI.

But it seems to work :) Check it out: [**_DoomPy App_**](https://doompy.streamlit.app)

## How To

Check out the [Overview](../README.md#overview) section of the DoomPy readme to learn how to use it. But if you played Doomlings once, i guess you will know how to use it.

## Bugs? Ideas?

Of course, if you find any bugs or space for improvements, just let me know!! Just open an [issue](https://github.com/azabicki/DoomPy/issues).
